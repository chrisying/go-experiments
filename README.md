# Random experiments in Go
Just random programs that I decided to write to practice Go while doing something cool!

* fractal: very cool fractal generator (with color!) for Mandlebrot and Julia sets (you can change the seed numbers!), includes a parallel implementation which actually runs slower than the sequential one

* seamcarve: contextual image cropping using a well-known dynamic programming algorithm

* edgedetect: an attempt a basic edge detection with a matrix map and a filter step

My style might not be entirely correct, I don't like gofmt's convention of 4 space indentation.
